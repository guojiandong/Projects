But that application will also involve some code to extract data out of access file and put image or image link back into it after process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For access module you can check following link.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.idautomation.com/fonts/qr-code/\">http://www.idautomation.com/fonts/qr-code/</a></p>\r\n<p>http://www.barcodesoft.com/qrcodeAccess.aspx</p>\r\n<p>http://www.morovia.com/fonts/qrcode/</p>",
