If you want to check full documentation I will post link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Renderer&amp;referringTitle=Documentation\">http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Renderer&amp;referringTitle=Documentation</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, as you want to use it on your website, are you using it with ASP.Net or Silverlight. As GraphicsRenderer is for Winform's Graphics class, which is under namespace System.Drawing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For silverlight, I haven't put it into main stream, but it is available under one of issue thread.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/workitem/695\">http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/workitem/695</a></p>\r\n<p>Download -&nbsp;<a id=\"FileLink3\" href=\"http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/Download/AttachmentDownload.ashx?ProjectName=qrcodenet&amp;WorkItemId=695&amp;FileAttachmentId=280\">SilverlightQR Geometry Control and Image control.7z</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Newest implementation will not simply ask you to input module size. It has two option, FixedCodeSize or FixedModuleSize.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CodeSize = QrCode's pixel width.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ModuleSize = QrCode each small module's width.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So now format is like this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{code:c#}</p>\r\n<p>GraphicsRenderer renderer =&nbsp;new GraphicsRenderer(</p>\r\n<pre>        <span>new</span> FixedCodeSize(200, QuietZoneModules.Two))</pre>\r\n<p>{code:c#}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you have further question just leave behind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For Silverlight I will sort it out and put it in before next release. The one I post there should work mostly fine.&nbsp;</p>",
