I did some research for creating 2D image for Silverlight. But same as what has been said from the link I provide earlier. Silverlight doesn't support 2D image. Shapes namespace under System.Windows.Media which is used by developer to create 2D shape. But they are all UIElement. Surely you don't want few hundred of them lay on your control just for a QrCode display. Use image file is best bet for now.</p>",
