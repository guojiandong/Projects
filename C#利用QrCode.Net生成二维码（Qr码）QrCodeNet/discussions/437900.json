The SVGRenderer is asking for GColor darkcolor and GColor lightcolor.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can not figure out how to define the darkcolor and lightcolor.  From the GColor class I see it's looking for RGBA values but everything I try is not working.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan you give an example of initializing the SVGRenderer?\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso in the documentation you talk about setting the viewbox width and height inside the renderer.  Are these attributes available after the renderer is initialized?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank You!<br />\n",
