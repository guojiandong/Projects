Which I rewrite not just control, but also for all renderer. One thing that I want to state will be CreateImageFile will not be there in any renderer in the future. You will be use WriteToStream instead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Simply create FileStream with path stick in, and pass that stream to WriteToStream method will do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example</p>\r\n<p>Using(Filestream stream = new Filestream(path, filecreatemode.create))</p>\r\n<p>{</p>\r\n<p>// code here that pass stream to renderer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>}</p>",
