Additionally, I read this code with an iPhone, and iPod, three different Android phone and they also work fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, on my Windows Phone 7.5 using the built in Bing scanner, it always prepends these two character on any QRcode generated from your library. Using the same Bing scanner, I've successfully read every QR code I physically have and all kinds of normal and augmented QR code images found from a google search. Actually, I would say that the Bing decoder is better than most of the other ones I've tried. But for some reason it wants to augment the string presented from your QRcodes.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny suggestions or things to try?<br />\n",
