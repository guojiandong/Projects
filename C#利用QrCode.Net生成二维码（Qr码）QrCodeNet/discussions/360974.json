    "Html": "\r\n<p>Looks like you have been using version 0.3 from download page. For that version you can change quiet zone outside of QrCode. But it's very limited. It will be either 2 or 4 modules wide. Module size is what you set up during creation for renderer class.\r\n 15 is what you give to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For 1px border, I'm not really sure what happen there, I will check code later. Also could you give me the image file you create, like post it on some image store website. I would like to see which kind of border it exist. That will be easier for me to find\r\n out what's going on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another note will be, there are updated source code under this project. You can download the newest version and compile on your own. I have recreate all renderer since 0.3, but there are few more changes to the library before push out next release. But at\r\n mean time, newly created renderer and control are all working properly. I can not say that pixel border won't happen in GraphicsRenderer, as I feel that issue might relate to Microsoft's own out of box bitmap.Save method. The good thing about new renderers\r\n is that some of them allow you to draw QrCode at specific position without quiet zone(border outside QrCode). Like WriteableBitmapRenderer, you can have your own WriteableBitmap source and drop QrCode at specific location (Set up quiet zone to zero if you\r\n are doing that). Then you can do all sorts of things with WriteableBitmap.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are locked with winform application, then quiet zone(border) will limit to zero, two, four models. But to be notice is that iMarti also created EncapsulatedPostScriptRenderer for this library. Which can create EPS files in winform or WPF. That's what's\r\n new in latest source code. Example will be inside source code project and document is under following link.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Renderer&referringTitle=Documentation\">http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Renderer&amp;referringTitle=Documentation</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit: &nbsp;For WriteableBitmap, if you want draw QrCode on some exist background that you have. Use DrawDarkModule method. That one won't draw light color module, which you can still see your own background after paint QrCode on it. Also as I said above,\r\n don't forget to set up QuietZone to zero, else QrCode will be paint at padding location.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

I think it relate to image size and actual paint area. Which inside 0.3 version, image size is equal to actual size plus one. That's what cause that happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is only one way to avoid is using latest version from source code instead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For quietzone, you can not set it to zero in 0.3. But you can reduce it to two after create renderer. &nbsp;For example: \"render.QuietZoneModules = QuietZoneModules.Two;\"</p>\r\n<p>I would suggest to use latest version from source code. Just compile it with release set up and grab dll file from it will do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also as you want save QrCode into database, I would suggest save as vector image. Which you can create in latest version from source code using EncapsulatedPostScriptRenderer. Vector image will be superior as it can scale to any size without damage image. You can also store matrix inside database instead of image file, Same reason, matrix's memory usage will be much smaller than image file and draw it on demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Detail about how to use latest renderer which I have posted at preview reply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let me know if you have further question.&nbsp;</p>",
