Server can by in latest .Net version.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou could use SharpDevelop IDE and combine with ServiceStack for server end, which can host locally. Then use VB6 to request. Return item could be Base64 format of byte array that describe the QrCode you have create. Then at end, use VB6.0 to paint on your UI. That's easiest I can think of, else you have to find VB6.0 library or rewrite it yourself.<br />\n",
