Those QrCode will never be main stream, they are for fun. They cause QrCode to not able to absorb any damage. Which it is one of QrCode's main ability. Lose that important ability equals lost in game. If a lot of people can not scan and get info from your code, what's point of creating and using it?\r<br />\n<br />\nOn that page's bottom you can see a wise man talking. Doubt anyone will read or try to understand. I will post again. \r<br />\n<br />\n__The only trouble is the more you modify the less parity you have in your QR code, meaning it’s more prone to errors. It has really high parity because phone cameras and lighting situations can combine to a really shitty photo; if you wipe out parity with a graphical overlay, people have to take <em>perfect</em> snaps of QR codes or it’ll end up corrupted. Not to discourage anyone from having a good time hacking them, just a thing to be aware of that you didn't really bring up in the article.__\r<br />\n<br />\nNo offense, but what he said is exactly true. I did a lot of test to come up with same conclusion as well. <br />\n",
