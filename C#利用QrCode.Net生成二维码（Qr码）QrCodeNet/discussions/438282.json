If you encode that string decoder will redirect you to that website. Unless you add something else inside. That's why I'm asking for what exactly you put into QrCode.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnother fact is that decoder might not support. Even though I have never encounter such case but it would be nice to create a QrCode and host at somewhere, post link to me so I can check out for you. <br />\n",
