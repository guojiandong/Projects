      "Message": "Hi. This might relate to two issues. I will list below. \r\n\r\n1st: string url format. Please according to this wiki and construct your input string. \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/BarcodeContents\r\nThat will make sure decoder application can properly pick up content of QrCode and recognise as Url. \r\n2nd: Depends on decoder. Some decoder can recognise that link as url even you don't follow the format according to that wiki. \"i-nigma\" is pretty good decoder application for mobile. \r\n\r\nPlease check for that two issue and let me know if still not work.
