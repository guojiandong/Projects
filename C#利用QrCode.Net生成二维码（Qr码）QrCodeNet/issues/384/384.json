    "Description": "<p>Hi, I wrote a WPF control for QRCode.Net.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I left off the &quot;artistic mode&quot; as in WPF you&#39;d just put your own banner across the control. You can change the background and foreground to any brush (imagebrush, gradient, solid color), and the &quot;padding&quot; property functions as the quiet zone...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#39;d submit a patch, but I&#39;m not sure exactly where you want to put my code - inside QrCode.Net, or in its own project etc. So I&#39;m attaching my version of your source but with two new projects, the WPF control and a test WPF application. I hope one of you guys will incorporate my code soon!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same code will *almost* work in silverlight (and on windows phone), but we&#39;d have to make some changes to Gma.QrCodeNet.Encoder first.</p>\n",
