      "Message": "I just generated one using our code under error level low. It can be properly read by i-nigma app. But I do have difficulty on reading code that's generated under level H. Since its way too big, error correction is not enough to fix code under 1920x1200 resolution monitor. (pretty much maximized QrCode image that generated under H). \r\n\r\nIf i-nigma cannot read such big code under that image size, don't expect general decoder able to read it. Also when you compare, make sure error level that use to generate code is same. level L code is much smaller than level H. Error correction bits are less.\r\n\r\nAlso are you serious about that big QrCode? Even though spec allow such big code, under normal condition its rare that you can assume average decoder can read properly. not saying it require you to print in large scale.",

      "Message": "Does the code I generate works for you?\n\nIf so you have to be careful, because some of decoder might have limit on decode. Like zxing decoder complain about code too big, while i-nigma can decode alright. \n\nTo encode, there are some example in source code, or I did a sub project a while ago. \nhttps://github.com/Nness/Silver-QrCode-Generator\n\nThe code above, I use that project to generate and save to png file.",
